# A-Common-Sense-Guide-to-Data-Structures---Algorithms---Book-Notes

*This is my summary of **A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures And Algorithms, Second Edition** by Jay Wengrow. This summary helps me learn and serves as a quick reference. It does not replace the book, so I recommend buying and reading it if you want to understand the concepts better. Use this repository as a guide and a reference only.*

**Please send me a DM by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/akuoko_konadu) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konaduakwasiakuoko-codedkaa/) if you are the publisher and you want this repository to be private. I will change the settings accordingly.**

Help the creator out by buying the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second/dp/1680507222). Just to clarify I ain't getting any money by linking the book here.
